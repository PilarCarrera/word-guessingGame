# word-guessingGame
Interactive and fun assembler game where you have to ¬guess a word selected randomly from a file called “listadoPalabras6Car”.
I have done this game in the second semester of my first year of university, in a class called Computer Introduction. This class consisted in learning the basis of assembler and how the computer worked in its deepest level, we used a aspberry-Pi in RiscOs, we used a Raspberry Pi 1B+ with a compiler the University of Cantabria provided for their students.
This specific code was my final project for the class, it consisted on the programming of complete, single or multi-level subroutines as well as structured programming with codes in multiple files
